# When should you use higher order components and pure components?
(< 150 words and/or < 20 LOC example, excl. headers)

# Answer
- Higher order components
    1. Need to share logic across multiple components without having to rewrite it, used by: redux (connect), react-router (withRouter), material-ui all using hoc (withStyle),
- Pure components 
    1. Avoid re-rendering cycles of component when its props and state are not changed
    2. The state and props of component are immutable
    3. You donâ€™t plan to implement your own shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method.
